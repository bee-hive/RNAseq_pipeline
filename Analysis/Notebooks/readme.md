# RNA-seq pipeline notebooks

<code>Last updated: 08/29/17</code>

All the relevant materials pertaining to this site can be found at:

<code>/tigress/BEE/RNAseq_pipeline/</code>

Under this directory, you will find:

- Analysis: Includes the summary markdown/notebook documents, as well as all the relevant figures
- Data: Mostly includes raw, static data, as well as some products of low-level processing
- Output: Includes all processed results of our analyses. Most of the data produced during our progress will belong here
- Scripts: Includes all scripts used to generate the output, for reference 

I'm writing a series of articles that provide information about different facets of our project, which is located in this directory. These are the project notebooks that I've written so far:
